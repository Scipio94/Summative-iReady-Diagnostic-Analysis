# iReady-Summative-Diagnostic-Analysis

## Abstract 

A charter School network utilizes the iReady diagnostic tool to indicate a student's academic gaps in both English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics. There are several diagnostic administrations throughout the school year in which a variety of metrics are produced in the iReady platform. The most commonly used metric is overall relative placement which is used for academic support as well as proficiency in a subject area. However, iReady diagnostic metrics are never compared to previous iReady performances leaving a potential gap for analysis, performance evaluation, and academic planning. This analysis intends to address this issue in an effort to assist the executive team and academic leaders in academic planning for the next school year.

2. What were the campus wide trends in iReady tier performance during the 2022-2023 school year in ELA?
3. What were the network wide trends in iReady proficiency performance during the 2022-2023 school year in ELA?
4. What were the campus wide trends in iReady proficiency  performance during the 2022-2023 school year in ELA?

## Analysis

There were four iReady administrations during the 2022-2023 school year. In each administration there was steady growth in students throughout the network moving into Tier 1. Overall there was a 28% increase in students moving into Tier 1 from iReady 1 to iReady 4, 22% to 50%. The largest spike in the percentage of students moving into Tier 1 was from iReady 1 to iReady 2 in which there was a 13% increase of students in Tier 1. On average there was a 7% increase in the percentage of students who moved into Tier 1 per iReady administration.

There is a slightly positive trend in the percentage of students that are considered to be proficient based on their iReady diagnostic scores. Overall there was an 8% increase in student proficiency from iReady 1 to iReady 4, 22% to 30%. The largest spike in proficiency was from iReady 2 to iReady 3, an 8% increase. There was also a 6% decrease in proficiency percentage from iReady 1 to iReady 2, 22% to 16%.The decrease from iReady 1 to iReady 2 this can be attributed to the change in formula to calculate proficiency in which “Early On Grade Level” is no longer considered to be proficient after iReady1. However, the network average proficiency rate was 23%. Also, on average there is a 2% increase in proficiency per iReady administration.

4. What were the campus wide trends in iReady proficiency  performance during the 2022-2023 school year in ELA?

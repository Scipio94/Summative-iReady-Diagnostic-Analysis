# iReady-Summative-Diagnostic-Analysis

## Abstract 

A charter School network utilizes the iReady diagnostic tool to indicate a student's academic gaps in both English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics. There are several diagnostic administrations throughout the school year in which a variety of metrics are produced in the iReady platform. The most commonly used metric is overall relative placement which is used for academic support as well as proficiency in a subject area. However, iReady diagnostic metrics are never compared to previous iReady performances leaving a potential gap for analysis, performance evaluation, and academic planning. This analysis intends to address this issue in an effort to assist the executive team and academic leaders in academic planning for the next school year.

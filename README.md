# iReady-Summative-Diagnostic-Analysis

## Abstract 

A charter School network utilizes the iReady diagnostic tool to indicate a student's academic gaps in both English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics. There are several diagnostic administrations throughout the school year in which a variety of metrics are produced in the iReady platform. The most commonly used metric is overall relative placement which is used for academic support as well as proficiency in a subject area. However, iReady diagnostic metrics are never compared to previous iReady performances leaving a potential gap for analysis, performance evaluation, and academic planning. This analysis intends to address this issue in an effort to assist the executive team and academic leaders in academic planning for the next school year.

## Objective

The analysis seeks to identify trends in iReady ELA performance in the Foundation Academy Charter School network. The analysis will be guided by the following questions:

1. What were the network wide trends in iReady tier performance during the 2022-2023 school year in ELA?
2. What were the campus wide trends in iReady tier performance during the 2022-2023 school year in ELA?
3. What were the network wide trends in iReady proficiency performance during the 2022-2023 school year in ELA?
4. What were the campus wide trends in iReady proficiency  performance during the 2022-2023 school year in ELA?
